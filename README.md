To start up the app for the first time:

1. Open up a terminal for the back-end of the app.
2. From the root directory, run `cd back-end`.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`. This will start the server on port 8080.

5. Open up a terminal for the front-end of the app.
6. From the root directory, run `cd front-end`.
7. Run `npm install`.
8. Run `npm start`. This will start the app on port 3000.

9. Set your `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development`. This will point the front-end to our server running at http://localhost:8080. On Windows, the command to do this is:
`$env:NODE_ENV = 'development'`
For the syntax to do this on other operating systems, refer to (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node_env-variables-and-how-to-use-them/).
